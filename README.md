# Griddify Yourself

This will be another portfolio project, but since you may want to stay with flexbox in the end, we're not going to be changing that repo. However, we _will_ be building off of your content, so we're going to fork our code.

However, you can't actually fork your own repo on GitHub, so we're going to copy the repo, make a _new_ repo on GitHub, and point the local at the remote. It's a slightly different way to make a GitHub repo, but it's very common as well, so getting familiar with it is a good idea.

### How To Griddify Yourself

* First, remove all `display: flex` in your code!
* Then, try to do the same layout using grid.
* Or do a different layout, as long as you have _at least_ three layouts based on the size (or orientation) of the viewport.
* Feel free to use `grid-template-areas` to make your life easier!
